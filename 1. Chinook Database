#This project utilizes multiple tables and advanced queries to analyze data from the Chinook database.


#1. I first needed to know which customers are not located in the United States of America.

SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country<>'USA'



#2. I wnated to see the invoice Id's and totals for our sales in Germany per customer.


 SELECT  c.CustomerId,  i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.Country, c.Email, c.SupportRepId, i.Total
FROM customers c
JOIN invoices i
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
AND c.Country='Germany'
ORDER BY c.CustomerId



#3. Here is the information for our sales staff along with who they report to.


SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName,
    e.LastName,
    e.Title,
    e.Email,
      r.Title AS ReportsTo,
    r.FirstName AS RFirst,
    r.LastName AS RLast,
    r.Email AS REmail
FROM 
    Employees e
JOIN 
    Employees r ON e.ReportsTo = r.EmployeeID
  WHERE e.Title like 'Sales%'




#4. I wanted to see the total sales from India grouped by year.

SELECT BillingCountry,
CASE WHEN InvoiceDate between '2009-01-01 00:00:0000' and '2009-12-31 00:00:0000' THEN '2009'
WHEN InvoiceDate between '2010-01-01 00:00:0000' and '2010-12-31 00:00:0000' THEN '2010'
WHEN InvoiceDate between '2011-01-01 00:00:0000' and '2011-12-31 00:00:0000' THEN '2011'
WHEN InvoiceDate between '2012-01-01 00:00:0000' and '2012-12-31 00:00:0000' THEN '2012'
WHEN InvoiceDate between '2013-01-01 00:00:0000' and '2013-12-31 00:00:0000' THEN '2013'
ELSE 'Null'
END AS 'Invoice_Year',
SUM(Total) AS 'Total_Revenue'
FROM invoices
WHERE BillingCountry='India'
GROUP BY Invoice_Year



#5. Next, I wanted to see the total sales per agent from 2009 to 2013.

SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.FirstName,
    e.LastName,
    ROUND(SUM(i.Total),2) AS Total_Sales
FROM 
    employees e
JOIN 
    customers c ON e.EmployeeID = c.SupportRepId
JOIN 
    invoices i ON c.CustomerID = i.CustomerID
    GROUP BY e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName




#6. I wanted to see the IDs of the items sold per invoice along with their unit cost and amount sold.

SELECT i.InvoiceId, t.TrackId, t.InvoiceLineId, t.UnitPrice, t.Quantity 
FROM invoices i
JOIN invoice_items t
ON i.InvoiceId=t.InvoiceId




#7. I needed to find how many times each song appears in the rock genre along with it's identifying information.

SELECT 
    pt.TrackId,  g.Name AS 'genre', 
    (SELECT COUNT(*)
     FROM playlist_track pt_inner
     JOIN tracks t_inner ON pt_inner.TrackId = t_inner.TrackId
     JOIN genres g_inner ON t_inner.GenreId = g_inner.GenreId
     WHERE pt_inner.TrackId = pt.TrackId AND g_inner.Name = 'Rock') AS 'total_appearances',

    t.Name AS 'track_name', 
    ab.title AS 'album_title', 
    t.Composer
FROM 
    playlists p
JOIN 
    playlist_track pt ON p.PlaylistId = pt.PlaylistId
JOIN 
    genres g ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId
JOIN 
    tracks t ON t.TrackId = pt.TrackId
JOIN 
    albums ab ON ab.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
WHERE 
    g.Name = 'Rock'
    GROUP BY pt.TrackId
