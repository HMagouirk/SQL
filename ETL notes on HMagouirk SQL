Data Sources: 

I've extracted data from these data sources: Khan Academy's github, bit.io's cloud database, the BIT_DB database, the chinook database, the Our World in Data website, and Kaggle.

When working with the World COVID data, I noticed a "Location" field that included locations around the world, plus income identifiers like "Lower Middle Income". 
I fixed this by creating a calculated field in Tableau that selected only the income fields, and I also filtered out the incomes from the Location field.

In Tableau, I've updated incomplete data when I imported the FebSales table and had to rename 'Column A' and 'Column B' to 'OrderID' and 'acctnum'. 
I also had to format the 'Order Date' attribute into the 'Date & Time' datatype.

Numerous instances of duplicate data were fixed by using "SELECT distinct" when running multiple queries.

I've merged mismatched fields when preparing the World Happiness Data in Tableau. This allowed me to merge columns from multiple different csv files so I could run my Tableau analysis across multiple years.
Multiple instances of messy data were also fixed when working with the Customer & Order Analytics data by filtering out Order IDs that were blank or incorrect.

I've loaded multiple databases into SQLite (BIT_DB and chinook), and I've also loaded multiple tables into the BIT_DB database (SpotifyData and CityBikeLanes). 
Additionally, I've loaded data into Tableau from csv files and from the BIT_DB database.
